# Monopoly Game Project
* The aim of this project is to create a basic version of the boardgame "Monopoly", with the aim of developing a Machine Learning or Neural Network based agent that can play the game to a "human level" of skill
* The initial development will require the creation of the game itself, which will need to be robust and tested
* The second stage of development will be creating the code necessary to make "AI agents" that can play the game
* The third stage will ideally be a method to view a game being played visually, or at the least being able to output the actions taken within a game to then review the course of the game
